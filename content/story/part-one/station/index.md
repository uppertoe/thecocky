### When the dogs stop snarling and the rails peter out,

When you’re no longer sure just where you’re about,

You’ll see a last platform with an air quite bereft.

Just sit there and wait for a train going left.

 

### And while you sit there, if you feel a bit flat,

Think of hot cocoa and nice things like that.

But just when you’re settled and start looking round,

The platform erupts with a great mocking sound.

It’s a manic crescendo of hysterical laughter

And the source of that sound sits high on a rafter.
