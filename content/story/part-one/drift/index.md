### … to get there you simply float out your door;

Take a sharp right, then go right once more.

Go far from the centre, drift along by the river;

Shrug off the strange chill that gnaws at your liver.

 

### Follow the rails past boarded-up stores,

Avoiding the puddles where the ice never thaws.

Pull your coat tightly, wind your scarf rightly;

Flee those dark thoughts that come to you nightly.

Ignore the stray dogs that nip at your heels,

And their breath as sour as distant ice fields.
