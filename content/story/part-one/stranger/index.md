### Deep in the gloom is a wise-looking creature -

An old kookaburra with the look of a teacher.

His eyes drill right through you, they fill you with fear.

What on earth could he be doing up there!
 

### He beckons you close with a long, ragged feather,

One nibbled by moths and years of damp weather.

Your feet shuffle nearer, despite feelings of danger -

What was it Mum said about talking to strangers?

Who could this be in a rumpled brown suit?

And whatâ€™s that strange odour like over-ripe fruit?
